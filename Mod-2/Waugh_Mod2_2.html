        <h1>Assignment 2.3 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>Getting to know me</h2>
        <p>My name is Derick and I in a class learning about HTML and how to create webpages. I am excited to learn how to do this properly. I learned a few things back nearly 25 years ago when my dad started learning how to create webpages. I learned more when MySpace was a thing and you could create your own designs for your own homepage.</p>
        <p>I am a husband and a father of 2. I'm an average guy with nerdy interests such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Final Fantasy, and Magic: the Gathering. I am a baseball fan. Go Rangers!</p>
        <p>I live in the not-so-little town of Paris, Texas. It's the second largest Paris in the world. We even have our own Eiffel Tower that stands a 65 feet tall. And it even has a cowboy hat on top (no kidding).</p>
        <p>I will admit, this felt a lot like I was filling out a dating profile. This was entertaining. I look foreward to the future and hopeful to tomorrow. I leave with this: Romans 7:15</p>
